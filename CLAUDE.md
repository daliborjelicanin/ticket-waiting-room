# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Goal

A Ticketmaster-style waiting room / high-demand ticket sale platform, built as an AWS
architecture portfolio piece. The core purpose is to demonstrate **real concurrency
handling** — atomic seat locking, distributed queueing, saga-based checkout — rather
than basic CRUD. Proving concurrency correctness under load is the main thing this
project needs to demonstrate; everything else is secondary.

## Architecture Phases

1. **Manual ECS + Fargate** — broad AWS service coverage, built by hand for learning depth
2. **Terraform** — same architecture rebuilt as infrastructure-as-code
3. **EKS** — migrate/re-platform onto Kubernetes

Check which phase is currently active before assuming a build tool, deployment target,
or infra format — the same logical architecture is intentionally rebuilt across phases.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java (JDK 26 / `openjdk-26`)
- Framework: Spring Boot microservices (Spring Boot 4.1.0 / Spring Framework 7)
- IDE config: `.idea/` is gitignored — IntelliJ regenerates it on Gradle import
- Build tool: Gradle multi-module monorepo (Kotlin DSL), wrapper pinned to Gradle 9.6.1
  (required: JDK 26 toolchain compilation needs Gradle >= 9.4.0)
- Java toolchain auto-provisioned per build via the `foojay-resolver-convention` plugin
  in `settings.gradle.kts` — a local JDK is only needed to launch Gradle itself
- Dependency versions centralized in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (version catalog)
- ~25 AWS services total — every service is chosen because it solves an actual
  problem in the system, never added purely for coverage

### Modules

- `common` — plain `java-library`, shared event/message DTOs (SQS/SNS/EventBridge
  contracts) and exception types. No dependency on any service module; services
  depend on it, never the reverse.
- `waiting-room-service`, `seat-inventory-service`, `checkout-payment-service`,
  `ticket-issuance-service`, `notification-service` — one Spring Boot app per bounded
  context, each an ECS Fargate task per CLAUDE.md's Compute section.

### Build Commands

- `./gradlew build` — build and test all modules
- `./gradlew test` — run tests only
- `./gradlew :waiting-room-service:bootRun` — run a single service (swap module name)
- `./gradlew projects` — list all modules
- `./gradlew :<module>:dependencies --configuration compileClasspath` — inspect a
  module's dependency tree (useful for checking `common` stays dependency-free)

Not yet added (deliberately deferred until the relevant phase/work needs them):
Lambda modules, Docker/Jib/`bootBuildImage` config, Terraform, CI workflow files.

## AWS Services by Category

**Compute**
- ECS Fargate — core services: Waiting Room, Seat Inventory, Checkout/Payment, Ticket Issuance, Notification
- Lambda — WebSocket connect/disconnect handlers, scheduled seat-hold expiration cleanup, QR code generation on ticket issuance
- ECR — image registry for the Fargate services

**Networking / Edge**
- API Gateway (REST) — catalog/checkout endpoints
- API Gateway (WebSocket) — real-time queue position and seat-map updates
- ALB — internal routing for REST services behind API Gateway
- CloudFront — static frontend + event banner images
- Route 53 — custom domain
- ACM — TLS certificates
- WAF — rate limiting and bot protection on the purchase endpoint (anti-scalping)
- VPC — public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, backend isolation

**Data**
- DynamoDB — seat inventory and holds: single-table design, conditional writes for atomic seat locking, TTL for auto-expiring holds. **This is the centerpiece of the project** and proves concurrency understanding.
- ElastiCache (Redis) — waiting-room queue ordering (sorted sets) and/or secondary distributed lock
- RDS (Postgres) — orders, payments, users — requires real ACID transactions
- S3 — event images, generated ticket QR codes, receipts

**Messaging / Events**
- SQS — decouples payment confirmation from ticket issuance
- SNS — fan-out for purchase confirmation (email/SMS)
- EventBridge — scheduled expired-hold cleanup, order lifecycle events
- Step Functions — orchestrates the checkout saga: hold seats → charge payment → issue tickets → notify, with compensation (release seats) on payment failure

**Security**
- Cognito — auth, including guest checkout
- IAM — distinct least-privilege role per service
- Secrets Manager — payment gateway keys, DB credentials
- KMS — encryption at rest for RDS/S3

**Observability**
- CloudWatch — logs, alarms, custom dashboard for queue depth, seats remaining, conversion rate
- X-Ray — tracing across the saga (Step Functions → Lambda → ECS)

**CI/CD**
- GitHub Actions + OIDC — no static AWS keys
- CodeDeploy (optional) — blue/green ECS deployments

## Key Design Decisions to Preserve

- **Concurrency is the point.** Every AWS service must earn its place by solving a
  concrete concurrency or reliability problem — do not add services just to inflate
  the count, and do not suggest simplifications that remove the concurrency mechanisms
  below in the name of "simpler CRUD."
- **Atomic seat locking via DynamoDB conditional writes**, not application-level locks
  or `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` — seat holds must be race-free under concurrent requests
  for the same seat.
- **TTL-based hold expiration** in DynamoDB, backed by an EventBridge-scheduled cleanup
  Lambda — holds must self-expire without relying solely on client behavior.
- **Redis sorted sets for queue ordering** — the waiting room's fairness guarantee
  (first-in-first-out admission) depends on this, not on request arrival order at
  the API layer.
- **Saga pattern via Step Functions** for checkout (hold seats → charge payment →
  issue tickets → notify), with explicit compensation (seat release) on payment
  failure — checkout must never leave seats held-but-unpaid indefinitely or silently
  drop a compensating action.
- **Postgres/RDS only for data that needs real ACID transactions** (orders, payments,
  users) — do not migrate this data to DynamoDB for consistency's sake; the split
  between DynamoDB (high-contention inventory) and Postgres (transactional records)
  is deliberate.
- **WAF in front of the purchase endpoint** specifically for anti-scalping/bot
  protection — this is a functional requirement of the domain, not generic hardening.

## Coding Conventions

- Target JDK 26 language features where they improve clarity (records, pattern
  matching, virtual threads) — this is a from-scratch project, so there is no legacy
  Java style to match.
- One Spring Boot service per bounded context (Waiting Room, Seat Inventory,
  Checkout/Payment, Ticket Issuance, Notification) — do not collapse services back
  into a monolith for convenience.
- Favor explicit, testable concurrency logic (conditional writes, optimistic locking,
  idempotency keys) over incidental thread-safety — the whole point of this codebase
  is that this logic is visible and correct, not hidden behind a framework default.
- No build system exists yet — when adding one, update this file's Tech Stack section
  with real build/test/lint commands rather than leaving them as placeholders.
